			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Overview</u></h2>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
					Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the clearest examples of human-induced climate modifications. The advent of thermal remote sensing has provided large-scale observations of urban environment, 
				        which greatly benefits the surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, the nature deficiency of satellite data leaves challenges in the SUHI investigation based on satellite observations, 
					and Jiameng Lai's recent researches mainly attempted to address these challenges. <br>

			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Current Projects</u></h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Attribution analysis of the daily variations in the nighttime surface urban heat island (SUHI)</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The overall intensity as well as footprint of the SUHI was quantified for Chinese cities, using the Gaussian model.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Vast variaions on the SUHI were demonstrated, not only over the inter-annual/intra-annual scale, but also over the day-to-day scale.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The day-to-day variations in the SUHI are mainly controlled by meteorological variables.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Meteorological controls on the SUHI intensity are larger in temperate zones than in subtropical zones.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (<b>Jiameng Lai is the first author</b>), and was submitted to <u><i>Remote Sensing of Environment</i></u> [under major revision].

			        <p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Simulating the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A statistical approach was proposed to simulate the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Simulators related to the SUHI day-to-day variations largely contribute to the simulation.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The simulated SUHI intensities have an averaged MAE of 0.67 K. <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (<b>Jiameng Lai is the first author</b>), and is in submission to <u><i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</i></u>.

				<p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Satellite-based investigation on the typical diurnal pattern of surface urban heat island</p>
						<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The satellite-based SUHI variations over a full diurnal cycle were re-constructed, using a four-parameter DTC model.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Diurnal climatology of the SUHI was estimated for Chinese 354 cities.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Five typical diurnal patterns of the SUHI intensity were identified.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Diurnal SUHI patterns are partly controlled by urban-rural NDVI differences. <br>	
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was published on <u><i>Remote Sensing of Environment</u></i> (<b>Jiameng Lai is the first author</b>) <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303973">[link]</a>.

					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The possible biases in the satellite-based SUHI quantification induced by the land surface temperature quality were emphasized.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Introducing satellite data quality control can modify the SUHI intensity (SUHII) by 24.3% (29.9%) during the day (night).<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Significant north-south contrast in the SUHI variations caused by LST quality were found in Chinese cities. <br>
