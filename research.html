			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Overview</u></h2>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
					Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the clearest examples of human-induced climate modifications. The advent of thermal remote sensing has provided large-scale observations of urban environment, 
				        which greatly benefit the surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, the nature deficiency of satellite data leave challenges in the SUHI investigation based on satellite observations, 
					and my recent researches mainly attempted to address these challenges. <br>
					</p>
			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Current Projects</u></h2>
				<h3 style="text-align:left">Attribution analysis of the daily variations in the nighttime surface urban heat island</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Vast variaions on the SUHI was demonstrated, not only over the inter-annual/intra-annual scale, but also on the day-to-day scale<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The day-to-day variations in the SUHI was mainly controlled by meteorological variables.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (<b>Jiameng Lai is the first author</b>), and was under the second view by <u><i>Remote Sensing of Environment</i></u>.
					</p>
			        <h3 style="text-align:left">Simulating the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A statistical approach was proposed to simulate the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Simulators related to the SUHI day-to-day variations largely contribute to the simulation.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (Jiameng Lai is the first author), and was under view by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sensing.

			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Past Projects</u></h2>
				<h3 style="text-align:left">Satellite-based investigation on the typical diurnal pattern of surface urban heat islands</h3>
						<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The satellite-based SUHI variations over a full diurnal cycle were re-constructed, using a four-parameter DTC model.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Diurnal climatology of the SUHI was estimated for Chinese 354 cities.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Five typical diurnal patterns of the SUHI intensity were identified.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was published on Remote Sensing of Environment (Jiameng Lai is the first author) <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303973">[link]</a>.

			<h3 style="text-align:left">Estimating the impact from the quality of satellite land surface temperature product on the surface urban heat island (SUHI) quantification</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The possible biases in the satellite-based SUHI quantification induced by the land surface temperature quality were emphasized.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Introducing satellite data quality control can modify the SUHI intensity (SUHII) by 24.3% (29.9%) during the day (night).<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was published on ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (Jiameng Lai is the first author) <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271618300777">[link]</a>.
