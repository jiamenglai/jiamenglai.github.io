					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
					Jiameng's research explores the interactions between the terrestrial biosphere, hydrosphere, climate and anthropogenic drivers at multiple scales. 
						To achieve that, she integrated state-of-the-art theoretical advances, satellite observations and other innovative multi-source data products, 
						terrestrial biosphere modeling, data assimilation, and machine learning, to seek knowledge advance and breakthrough solutions for challenges 
						in sustainable development over diverse ecosystems.  <br>
						<br>
					Currently her research programs are focused on the following two themes: <br>
						<b>[1] For natural/agricultural ecosystems, how to understand and predict the long-term response/feedbacks of carbon-water cycle to climate change/variability?</b> <br>
						<b>[2] For urban ecosystems, how to better monitor, understand, and adapt to the human-induced climate modifications.</b>  <br>

						OCS is an atmospheric trace gas which can serve as a photosynthetic tracer, as it shares a similar pathway with CO2 while diffusing from the air to plant cells. 
						Mesophyll acts as one major barrier to both CO2 and OCS diffusion. However, current terrestrial biosphere models do not take explicit consideration of mesophyll diffusion. 
						This project shows that an explicit implementation of mesophyll diffusion in models can lead to a better agreement between simulation and site measurement of OCS fluxes, 
						and the simulated mesophyll-explicit OCS can provide new insight on estimates of global GPP budget. <br>
						A paper related to this project (Jiameng is the first author) has been submitted to <u><i>Nature</i></u> and is under major revision.<br>

						Much information of photosynthesis and carbon cycling was embedded in the stable carbon isotope, as plants discriminate against heavier carbon isotope. 
						The process of isotope discrimination has been implemented in most terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). However, with NCAR CLM5, 
						we found the standard equation cannot reproduce the historical long-term increase of isotope discrimination as deduced from atmospheric 13C/12C measurements. 
						We attributed such a mismatch to the missed representation of photorespiration and, particularly, mesophyll diffusion. 
						Updating the discrimination equation by leveraging a mechanistic mesophyll diffusion model, we reproduce the trend towards a larger discrimination under higher CO2 levels: 
						globally the trend is 0.014‰ ppm−1, consistent with atmospheric measurements. <br>
						A draft paper related to this project (Jiameng is the first author) has been finished.<br>

						This project focused on Northwestern China, which is one of the major global hotspots undergoing massive terrestrial water storage (TWS) depletion.
						However, unlike many of other hotspots, drivers underlying the region-wide depletion remain controversial over this dryland ecosystem. 
						Utilizing diverse observations, we found persistent cropland expansion by >1.2 × 104 km2 since 2003, leading to growth of 59.9% in irrigated area and 19.5% in agricultural water use, 
						despite a steady enhancement in irrigation efficiency. Correspondingly, a substantially faster evapotranspiration (ET) increase occurred in crop expansion areas, whereas precipitation exhibited no long-term trend. 
						This enhanced evaporative water loss is the most plausible and ultimate cause underlying the region-wide water depletion.   <br>

					Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the clearest examples of human-induced climate modifications. The advent of thermal remote sensing has provided large-scale observations of urban environment,
