						Much information of photosynthesis and carbon cycling was embedded in the stable carbon isotope, as plants discriminate against heavier carbon isotope. 
						The process of isotope discrimination has been implemented in most terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). However, with NCAR CLM5, 
						we found the standard equation cannot reproduce the historical long-term increase of isotope discrimination as deduced from atmospheric 13C/12C measurements. 
						We attributed such a mismatch to the missed representation of photorespiration and, particularly, mesophyll diffusion. 
						Updating the discrimination equation by leveraging a mechanistic mesophyll diffusion model, we reproduce the trend towards a larger discrimination under higher CO2 levels: 
						globally the trend is 0.014‰ ppm−1, consistent with atmospheric measurements. <br>

						Gross primary production (GPP) is the largest carbon sink on land. Its global magnitude has historically been estimated at ~120 Pg C/yr, 
						 which is 30-50 Pg C/yr lower than estimates from oxygen-18 isotope (O18) and soil respiration. This discrepancy causes significant uncertainties 
						 in predicting carbon-climate feedbacks. Using OCS as an innovative tracer, Jiameng inferred a global GPP of 157 (±8.5) Pg C/yr,

						This project focused on Northwestern China, which is one of the major global hotspots undergoing massive terrestrial water storage (TWS) depletion.
						However, unlike many of other hotspots, drivers underlying the region-wide depletion remain controversial over this dryland ecosystem. 
						Utilizing diverse observations, we found persistent cropland expansion by >1.2 × 104 km2 since 2003, leading to growth of 59.9% in irrigated area and 19.5% in agricultural water use, 
						despite a steady enhancement in irrigation efficiency. Correspondingly, a substantially faster evapotranspiration (ET) increase occurred in crop expansion areas, whereas precipitation exhibited no long-term trend. 
						This enhanced evaporative water loss is the most plausible and ultimate cause underlying the region-wide water depletion.   <br>
