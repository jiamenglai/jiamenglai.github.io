					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Urban and Thermal Remote Sensing Group, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -With Google Earth Engine (GEE) for computing platform, auxiliary platform based on ArcGIS/Python, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  using MODIS temperature/vegetation index/land cover product data, coding to achieve the filter of the<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  world’s 11848 cities/the calculation of urban heat island intensity/ the linear regression between <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  vegetation index and surface temperature, and on the basis of calculation results, I analyzed the <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Spatio-temporal Pattern between the urban heat island intensity and surface temperature/vegetation index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of 18 years data in the worldwide, and then I wrote a report, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan of <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  School of Geographic and Oceanographic Science in Nanjing University.<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The project was completed by myself

			    <h3 style="text-align:left"><font color="grey">03/2017 – 12/2018</font>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Innovation Training Program: Research on Qinhuai River Basin Health | Nanjing University, China</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Supervised by Professor Youpeng Xu<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Water quality data, land use data and socio-economic data were used to calculate the Water Surface Rate,<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Water Quality Comprehensive Index and Green Space Coverage Rate, Shannon’s Diversity Index, Growth Rate <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of Agricultural and Forestry Output Value and Water Consumption per Ten Thousand yuan of GDP, respectively, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  so as to make a comprehensive evaluation of river health in Qinhuai River Basin.<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -I am responsible for dividing the study area and calculating the Green Space Coverage Rate and Shannon’s Diversity<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Index from the land use data. Firstly, the study area was divided into 10 small watersheds through administrative<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  division boundaries in ArcGIS. Secondly, land use data were overlayed with the divided 10 small watersheds in ArcGIS<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  to calculate the Green Space Coverage Rate. Finally, fragstats was used to calculate the Shannon’s Diversity Index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of each watershed
