					Jiameng's research explores the interactions between the terrestrial biosphere, hydrosphere, climate and anthropogenic drivers at multiple scales. 
						To achieve that, she integrated state-of-the-art theoretical advances, satellite observations and other innovative multi-source data products, 
						terrestrial biosphere modeling, data assimilation, and machine learning, to seek knowledge advance and breakthrough solutions for challenges 
						in sustainable development over diverse ecosystems.  <br>
					Currently her research programs are focusing on the following two themes: <br>
						<u>For natural/agricultural ecosystems</u>, how to understand and predict the long-term response/feedbacks of carbon-water cycle to climate change/variability? <br>
						<u>For urban ecosystems</u>, how to better monitor, understand, and adapt to the human-induced climate modifications.  <br>

			<p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Effect of explicit consideration of mesophyll diffusion to carbonyl sulfide (OCS) simulation and implication to GPP estimate</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						OCS is an atmospheric trace gas which can serves as photosynthetic tracer, as it shares the similar pathway with CO2 while diffusing from the air to plant cells. 
						Mesophyll acts as one major barrier to both CO2 and OCS diffusion. However, current terrestrial biosphere models do not take explicit consideration of mesophyll diffusion. 
						This project shows that an explicit implementation of mesophyll diffusion in models can lead to a better agreement between simulation and site measurement of OCS fluxes, 
						and the simulated mesophyll-explicit OCS can provide new insight on estimates of global GPP budget. <br>
						A paper related to this project (Jiameng is the first author) has been submitted to <i>Nature</i> and was under major revision.<br>
					</p>
			<p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Contributio from mesophyll diffusion to historical increase of C13 discriminations</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						Much information of photosynthesis and carbon cycling was embedded in the stable carbon isotope, as plants discriminate against heavier carbon isotope. 
						The process of isotope discrimination has been implemented in most terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). However, with NCAR CLM5, 
						we found the standard equation cannot reproduce the historical long-term increase of isotope discrimination as deduced from atmospheric 13C/12C measurements. 
						We attributed such a mismatch to the missed representation of photorespiration and, particularly, mesophyll diffusion. 
						Updating the discrimination equation by leveraging a mechanistic mesophyll diffusion model, we reproduce the trend towards a larger discrimination under higher CO2 levels: 
						globally the trend is 0.014‰ ppm−1, consistent with atmospheric measurements. <br>
						A draft paper related to this project (Jiameng is the first author) has been finished.<br>

			<p style="text-align:left; font-size:130%; font-weight:700; color: #00A">Historical trend of water use efficiency (WUE) and its drivers</p>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						Historical increase in WUE (ratio of gross photosynthesis to transpiration) was found responding to the rising CO2. 
						However, the magnitude and evolution of such an increase over various biomes and scales is poorly understood, and the factors driving such an increase remain debatable. 
						This ongoing project aims to improve our understanding of the historical WUE trends under changing climate and enviromental stresses. <br>

					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						This project aims to use CLM5-DART to assimilate MODIS LAI and SMAP soil moisture in East Africa, and analyze how data assimilation affect the carbon cycle modeling.  <br>

			<h2 style="text-align:left"><u>Theme 2</u>:  understanding and predicting the long-term response/feedbacks of carbon-water cycle to climate change/variability</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
					Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the clearest examples of human-induced climate modifications. The advent of thermal remote sensing has provided large-scale observations of urban environment, 
				which greatly benefits the surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, the nature deficiency of satellite data leaves challenges in the SUHI investigation based on satellite observations, 
				and Jiameng's researches attempted to address these challenges.<br>

					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The overall intensity as well as footprint of the SUHI was quantified for 59 Chinese cities, using the Gaussian model.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Large variaions on the SUHI were demonstrated, not only over the inter-annual/intra-annual scale, but also over the day-to-day scale.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The day-to-day variations in the SUHI are mainly controlled by meteorological variables.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Meteorological controls on the SUHI intensity are larger in temperate than in subtropical zones.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (Jiameng is the first author), and was submitted to <u><i>Remote Sensing of Environment</i></u> [revised and under the third round of review].

					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A simple yet efficient approach was proposed to statistically simulate the next-day nighttime surface urban heat islands.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Simulators related to the SUHI day-to-day variations largely contribute to the simulation.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The simulated SUHI intensities have an averaged MAE of 0.67 K. <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was finished (Jiameng is the first author), and was submitted to <u><i>ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</i></u>.

						<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The satellite-based SUHI variations over a full diurnal cycle were re-constructed, using a four-parameter DTC model.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Diurnal climatology of the SUHI was estimated for Chinese 354 cities.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Five typical diurnal patterns of the SUHI intensity were identified.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Diurnal SUHI patterns are partly controlled by urban-rural NDVI differences. <br>	
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - A paper related to this project was published on <u><i>Remote Sensing of Environment</u></i> (Jiameng is the first author) <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303973">[link]</a>.

						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - The possible biases in the satellite-based SUHI estimation induced by the land surface temperature quality were emphasized.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Introducing satellite data quality control can modify the SUHI intensity (SUHII) by 24.3% (29.9%) during the day (night).<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - Significant north-south contrast in the SUHI variations caused by LST quality was found over Chinese cities. <br>
