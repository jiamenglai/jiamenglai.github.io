			<h2 style="text-align:left">Overview</h2>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
					Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the clearest examples of human-induced climate modifications. The advent of thermal remote sensing has provided large-scale observations of urban environment, 
				        which greatly benefit the surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, the nature deficiency of satellite data leave challenges in the SUHI investigation based on satellite observations, 
					and my recent researches mainly attempted to address these challenges. <br>
					</p>
			<h2 style="text-align:left">Current Projects</h2>
				<h3 style="text-align:left">Attribution analysis of the daily variations in the nighttime surface urban heat island</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Vast variaions on the SUHI was demonstrated, not only over the inter-annual/intra-annual scale, but also on the day-to-day scale<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The day-to-day variations in the SUHI was mainly controlled by meteorological variables.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -A paper related to this project was finished (Jiameng Lai is the first author), and was under the second view by Remote Sensing of Environment.
					</p>
			        <h3 style="text-align:left">Simulating the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -A statistical approach was proposed to simulate the next-day nighttime surface urban heat island.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Simulators related to the SUHI day-to-day variations largely contribute to the simulation.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -A paper related to this project was finished (Jiameng Lai is the first author), and was under view by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

				<h3 style="text-align:left"><font color="grey">09/2018 – 02/2019</font>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Produce Practice: Research on the Spatio-temporal Pattern of Global Urban Heat Island | Nanjing University, China</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Urban and Thermal Remote Sensing Group, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -With Google Earth Engine (GEE) for computing platform, auxiliary platform based on ArcGIS/Python, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  using MODIS temperature/vegetation index/land cover product data, coding to achieve the filter of the<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  world’s 11848 cities/the calculation of urban heat island intensity/ the linear regression between <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  vegetation index and surface temperature, and on the basis of calculation results, I analyzed the <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Spatio-temporal Pattern between the urban heat island intensity and surface temperature/vegetation index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of 18 years data in the worldwide, and then I wrote a report, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan of <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  School of Geographic and Oceanographic Science in Nanjing University.<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The project was completed by myself

			    <h3 style="text-align:left"><font color="grey">03/2017 – 12/2018</font>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Innovation Training Program: Research on Qinhuai River Basin Health | Nanjing University, China</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Supervised by Professor Youpeng Xu<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Water quality data, land use data and socio-economic data were used to calculate the Water Surface Rate,<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Water Quality Comprehensive Index and Green Space Coverage Rate, Shannon’s Diversity Index, Growth Rate <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of Agricultural and Forestry Output Value and Water Consumption per Ten Thousand yuan of GDP, respectively, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  so as to make a comprehensive evaluation of river health in Qinhuai River Basin.<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -I am responsible for dividing the study area and calculating the Green Space Coverage Rate and Shannon’s Diversity<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Index from the land use data. Firstly, the study area was divided into 10 small watersheds through administrative<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  division boundaries in ArcGIS. Secondly, land use data were overlayed with the divided 10 small watersheds in ArcGIS<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  to calculate the Green Space Coverage Rate. Finally, fragstats was used to calculate the Shannon’s Diversity Index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of each watershed
